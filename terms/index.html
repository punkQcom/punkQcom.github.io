            <h2>5. Content and Ownership</h2>
            <p>You retain full ownership of the files you upload. We do not claim any rights over your content. By uploading files, you grant us a limited license to store, transmit, and display your content solely to provide the Service.</p>

            <h2>6. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
            <p>The Service offers free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans are billed monthly. You can view current pricing on our <a href="/pricing/">Pricing</a> page.</p>
            <p>Payments are processed by our third-party payment provider. By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorise recurring monthly charges until you cancel. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time from inside the plugin.</p>
            <p>When you cancel, your paid features remain active until the end of the current billing period. After that, your account reverts to the Free plan.</p>

            <p>Refunds are not available for subsequent billing periods after the initial 14-day window. You can cancel at any time to prevent future charges.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>8. Availability</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time.</p>
