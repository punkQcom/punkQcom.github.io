            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>This privacy policy explains how VST Collaboration, operated by punkQ ("we", "us"), collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our plugin and related services.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in via Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or Discord, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture from the OAuth provider. We do not receive or store your password.</p>
            <p><strong>File data:</strong> We store the files you upload and associated metadata (file names, sizes, paths, timestamps).</p>
            <p><strong>Usage data:</strong> We track storage usage and feature limits to enforce subscription tiers.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment information:</strong> We do not collect or store credit card numbers or payment details. All payment processing is handled by our third-party payment provider. See section 6 below.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authenticate you and maintain your session</li>
                <li>Store and deliver your files</li>
                <li>Share files with collaborators you invite</li>
                <li>Manage your subscription and enforce storage limits</li>
                <li>Send transactional emails (invitations, QuickShare links)</li>
                <li>Respond to support requests</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>4. Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your files are stored in Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure with encryption at rest and in transit. Access to your files is controlled by scoped, time-limited security tokens. We use HTTPS for all communications between the plugin, our backend, and cloud storage.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your data. We share data only with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collaborators you invite</strong> — project members can see files in shared project folders</li>
                <li><strong>QuickShare recipients</strong> — anyone with a QuickShare link can access the shared folder</li>
                <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — Microsoft Azure (hosting, storage), our payment provider (billing), and email delivery services, solely to operate the Service</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>6. Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>Payments for subscription plans are processed by a third-party merchant of record. They handle all payment details, tax collection, invoicing, and compliance. We receive only your subscription status and plan information — never your payment card details. The payment provider's own privacy policy applies to payment data.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
            <p>This website does not use cookies or tracking scripts. The plugin communicates directly with our backend API and does not use browser cookies.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access your data</strong> — view your files and account information inside the plugin</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your files</strong> — remove any file at any time from inside the plugin</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> — permanently delete your account and all associated data from the Account tab in the plugin</li>
                <li><strong>Request data export</strong> — contact us to request a copy of your data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For data requests, contact <a href="mailto:support@punkq.com">support@punkq.com</a>.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your account and file data as long as your account is active. When you delete your account, all your data (files, projects, collaborator links) is permanently removed. We do not keep backups of deleted accounts.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Service is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 16. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
            <br>
