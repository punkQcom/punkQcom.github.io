            <h2>What is VST Collaboration?</h2>
            <p>VST Collaboration is a VST3 plugin that lets you share project files directly inside your DAW. No more emailing stems or switching between apps — everything happens right where you make music. Open the plugin, upload your files, and collaborate with your team.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Sign in with Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or Discord. Your files are stored securely in the cloud. Invite collaborators to your projects, and everyone sees the same file tree inside their DAW.</p>
            <p>Share files instantly with QuickShare links — anyone with the link can download (or upload) without installing the plugin.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Files</strong> &mdash; Upload, download, and organise files in your Personal and Shared storage. Drag and drop files or right-click for more options.</li>
                <li><strong>QuickShare</strong> &mdash; Create a temporary web link to your folders. Anyone with the link can download files via webpage, or also upload if given read-write permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Projects</strong> &mdash; Create a project and invite collaborators by email. Members can upload and download files in the shared project folder.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Plans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free</strong> &mdash; 200 MB storage, 1 project, 1 collaborator, 1 QuickShare</li>
                <li><strong>Starter</strong> &mdash; 5 GB storage, 10 projects, 5 collaborators, 10 QuickShares</li>
                <li><strong>Pro</strong> &mdash; 50 GB storage, unlimited projects, 10 collaborators, unlimited QuickShares</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Supported DAWs</h2>
            <p>Any DAW with VST3 support.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Current Status</h2>
